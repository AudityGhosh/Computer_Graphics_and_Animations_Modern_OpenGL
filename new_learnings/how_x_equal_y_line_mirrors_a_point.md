# Reflection Across Line x = y  
### Geometric Proof Using Slopes and Midpoint

---

## 📌 Problem

Reflect point:

A(3, 5)

Across the line:

x = y

Expected reflected point:

H(5, 3)

---

## 🔷 Step 1: Identify the Mirror Line

The mirror line is:

x = y

Rewrite:

y = x

Slope of mirror line:

m₁ = 1

---

## 🔷 Step 2: Use Perpendicular Property of Reflection

Property:

> The mirror line is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining original and reflected point.

So if:

m₁ = 1

Then perpendicular slope:

m₂ = -1

Because:

m₁ × m₂ = -1  
1 × (-1) = -1

---

## 🔷 Step 3: Equation of Perpendicular Line Through A(3,5)

Using point-slope form:

y - 5 = -1(x - 3)

Expanding:

y - 5 = -x + 3  
y = -x + 8  

Rewriting:

x + y = 8

---

## 🔷 Step 4: Find Intersection with Mirror Line

Mirror line:

x = y

Substitute into:

x + y = 8  

x + x = 8  
2x = 8  
x = 4  

Since x = y:

M = (4,4)

---

## 🔷 Step 5: Use Midpoint Formula

Since mirror line is perpendicular bisector:

M is midpoint of AH

Midpoint formula:

M = ((x₁ + x₂)/2 , (y₁ + y₂)/2)

So:

(4,4) = ((3 + x_H)/2 , (5 + y_H)/2)

Solve:

(3 + x_H)/2 = 4 → x_H = 5  
(5 + y_H)/2 = 4 → y_H = 3  

Final reflected point:

H = (5,3)

✔ Proven

# 🔷 Why Reflection Across x = y Swaps Coordinates

For any point:

(x, y) → (y, x)

Because:
- The line x = y makes 45°
- Horizontal and vertical distances interchange
- The line acts as perpendicular bisector

# 🔷 Connection to 8-Point Circle Symmetry

In circle symmetry, one calculated point (x, y) generates:

(x, y)  
(y, x)  
(-x, y)  
(-y, x)  
(x, -y)  
(y, -x)  
(-x, -y)  
(-y, -x)

This works because:
- Reflections across x-axis
- Reflections across y-axis
- Reflections across line x = y
- Reflections across line x = -y

All are symmetry transformations.

# 🧠 Key Insight

Reflection is governed by:

1. Perpendicular slope  
2. Intersection point  
3. Midpoint property  

This geometric reasoning is the foundation behind the 8-way symmetry used in the Midpoint Circle Algorithm.
